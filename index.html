    <br> <br/>
     UX/UI Designer with background in Linguistics, Literature, and Art History.<br> <br/>    
      
      I am a passionate learner and often feel captivated by human behavior and interactions. Having studied Foreign Languages, I learned the way words can make or break a conversation or a product.
      Studying Literature, I noticed how important it is to know WHO you are trying to communicate your ideas to, and how to make your thought process more understandable to others.
      Art History taught me that everyone needs to have visual literacy and cultural awareness.
      Now, having learned so much about human nature, I want to understand the way we interact with technology and help create positive experiences for users.
